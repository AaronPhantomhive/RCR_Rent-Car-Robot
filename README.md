# Watson Assistant Basic starter kit [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/IBM_Cloud-powered-blue.svg)](https://bluemix.net)


This Java Spring app demonstrates the [Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant/) service in a simple interface engaging in a series of simple simulated banking tasks.

## Getting started

### Configuring workspace

The following steps are to optionally retrieve a workspace id and configure it for your application. If you do not configure a workspace id, the first workspace in your space will be used, or a new workspace will be created.

1. From the [Resource list](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources) click on your Watson Assistance instance

1. From the **Manage** page, click **Launch tool**.

1. Click the dots in the upper right hand corner for the workspace you want and click **View details**

1. Copy the `Workspace ID` into the *src/main/resources/application.properties* file replacing the `WORKSPACE_ID`

### Running locally

The following steps are for running locally from a JAR file. You can also [run locally with Docker.](#running-locally-with-docker)

1. Install the prerequisites:
    - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
    - Java 8
        - [Java 8 JDK from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
        - [Java 8 JDK from IBM (AIX, Linux, z/OS, IBM i)](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/)

1. At the command line, go to your application directory.

1. Run the following command to package the application.
    ```
    mvn clean package
    ```

1. Run the following command to start the application. Replace `AssistantBasic-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` with the name of the *.jar* file generated by the previous step.
    ```
    java -jar ./target/AssistantBasic-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```

1. Point your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Deploying to IBM Cloud as a Cloud Foundry application

1. Login to IBM Cloud with the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/index.html#overview):

    ```
    ibmcloud login
    ```

1. Target a Cloud Foundry organization and space:

    ```
    ibmcloud target --cf
    ```

1. Deploy the application:

    ```
    ibmcloud app push
    ```
    The application will be deployed with the settings in your *manifest.yml* file.

1. Access your app at the URL specified in the command output.

    After your app is deployed, you can manage it from your [IBM Cloud resource list](https://cloud.ibm.com/dashboard/apps).

## Running locally with Docker

1. Install the [IBM Cloud CLI tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/index.html#overview).

1. Run the Docker application.

1. Build the Docker container:

    ```sh
    ibmcloud dev build
    ```
    The build may take a few minutes to complete.

1. Run the Docker container:

    ```sh
    ibmcloud dev run
    ```

1. Point your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## P.S.
- If jdk version occurs error, in configuration use `--add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED` to solve.
